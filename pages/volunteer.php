			<h3>Volunteer</h3>
			<p>Jamyang Foundation welcomes volunteers at its education programs for Buddhist women in the Indian Himalayas.
        Students are keen to learn English, arithmetic, science, computer skills, gardening, leadership skills, Hindi,
        accounting, health care, and other subjects. Help with our new gardens and trees is also much appreciated!</p>

	<h4>Why Volunteer</h4>

			<p>There are many reasons why volunteers love teaching at the Jamyang Foundation
			programs. The nuns are excellent students: smart, motivated, and funny. They treat
			teachers with enormous respect, and they also become wonderful friends. The Jamyang
			Foundation schools are ideal places for new teachers to gain first-hand teaching
			experience. The small classes and friendly students are an excellent introduction to
			teaching, and also a great experience for retired or vacationing professional teachers.
			After teaching in large public schools, many teachers find a class of six to ten eager
			students a welcome change. The most important qualifications for teachers are patience,
			kindness, a flexible and adventurous spirit, a willingness to teach, and a willingness to
			learn. </p>

	<h4>Cultural Immersion</h4>

		<div class="medium-9 columns">
			<p>Living in one of the monasteries sponsored by Jamyang Foundation is a great experience in
			itself. At each school, there is a rich mix of local culture and elements of north Indian and Tibetan
			cultures. Volunteers at the various projects have participated in Buddhist pujas (religious
			services), had tea with learned lamas (religious teachers), befriended local villagers, learned
			snippets of many languages, attended parties and traditional Buddhist weddings, learned how to
			cook local foods, and gained insight into a variety of cultures. Teaching at these monasteries is an unforgettable
			experience. Teaching give volunteers a glimpse of Himalayan life, well off the beaten tourist trail,
			and an opportunity to make a valuable contribution to needy communities. </p>

			<p>The Jamyang Foundation schools are located in three different regions of the Himalayas:
			Zangskar, Kinnaur and Spiti. Teachers are desperately needed at projects in these remote
			mountain areas! The journey is arduous, but the mountains are magical. The roads to the schools
			in Zangskar and Spiti are generally only open during the summer months. Although the region is
			remote and the climate can be nippy, teaching in these Himalayan schools is an unforgettable
			adventure.</p>

	<h4>Lasting Friendships</h4>
		<div class="large-12 columns">
			<p>Volunteers from past years are happy to share their experiences with new volunteers. After
			teaching and living with the nuns, volunteers develop deep friendships and respect for their
			students, both as individuals and as a community. The studentsâ€™ sincerity and commitment to
			their unique way of life is very inspiring. Visiting teachers help the nuns work toward their
			educational goals by providing a broad range of studies that would not be available without
			volunteer help. For more information, or to make arrangements for a volunteer teaching position,
			please write us: tsomo@sandiego.edu. Please tell us about yourself: your education,
			professional background, any language skills, travel experience, volunteer experience, and what
			skills you would like to share as a volunteer in the Himalayas.</p>
