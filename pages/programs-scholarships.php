			<h3>Scholarship Programs</h3>
			<p>Buddhist women in Bangladesh face many challenges in their pursuit of education. One of the greatest challenges for women is inadequate preparation at the
			primary level. The poor quality of schooling hampers girls in pursuing secondary and higher education. Another challenge is financial. Parents are unable to
			afford to buy uniforms and books to enable their education.</p>

			<p>In 2002, four young women from the Marma Buddhist community in Rajasthali, Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh, were selected to study in Thailand. This was
			an important step, since few girls in Bangladesh have ever had the opportunity for a Buddhist education. In May 2007, Azaima Marma completed a B.A. in Buddhist
			Studies at Mahapajapati Buddhist College and is now studying for an M.A. at Mahachulalongkorn University in Bangkok. In May 2010, U Mra Ching Marma and Hla Shwe
			U Marma completed B.A. degrees in Buddhist Studies at Mahapajapati Buddhist College and are currently serving as teachers at Visakha School in Bangladesh. They
			hope to pursue graduate studies next year. A new student, U Nyo Mra Marma, is now in her second year at Mahapajapati Buddhist College.</p>

			<p>In 2006, four young women from the Chittagong Hill Tracts who were studying at the University of Chittagong applied to Jamyang Foundation for assistance to
			continue their studies. Because of the poverty and educational disadvantages, it is rare for young woman from tribal areas to pursue higher education. On the
			basis of their academic achievement and financial need, four students were awarded scholarships. The scholarships are renewable annually, based on continued
			academic achievement. A ceremony to celebrate the awards and honor these young women was held at the office of the District Executive Officer at Rajasthali
			in April 2007. All four students have now completed B.A. degrees in the Department of Oriental Languages (Pali and Sanskrit) at Chittagong University and are
			currently studying for an M.A.</p>

			this basis, they were selected for full scholarships. These scholarships are also renewable annually, based on continued academic achievement. Dorje Dolma is
			currently completing a B.A. in Sanskrit at Kullu College. Tensin Dadon (Sonam Wangmo) completed an M.A. in Buddhist Studies at the University of Delhi and is
