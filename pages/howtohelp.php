	<h4>Volunteer Service</h4>
		<div class="large-12 columns">
			<p>Jamyang Foundation welcomes volunteers at all its education programs for women in the
			Himalayas. Students in these programs are keen to learn English, arithmetic, gardening,
			leadership skills, Hindi, social studies, accounting, and health care. Simple vegetarian food and housing are
			provided. Volunteers must take care of their own travel expenses, health insurance, and
			incidentals.</p>

			<p>A background in teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) is helpful, but not required. The
			most important qualifications for teachers are patience and openmindedness. As a mark of
			respect for the students' monastic lifestyle, volunteers are asked to familiarize themselves with
			local etiquette. Elementary English textbooks are available at most locations, but it would be
			helpful to bring additional textbooks or teaching tools. Volunteers are also very welcome to help
      with planting and caring for trees, flowers, and vegetable gardens.</p>

			<p>The monasteries in Zangskar, the most remote location, as especially in need of volunteers. Opportunities
        may also be available at monasteries in Kinnaur and Spiti. Most volunteer opportunities are available during
        the summer months, due to the Himalayan mountain climate. The summer is beautiful, but the winter is icy cold
        with lots of snow. The roads there are generally only open from June to September. The mildest climate is found
        in Kinnaur, where it is possible to stay through the winter. During the winter month, it is also possible to
        volunteer at Sanghamitra Institute in Bodhgaya, which is easy to reach from Delhi or Kolkata.</p>

			<p>The weather varies greatly at the different locations. At the monasteries in the Himalayas, the
			summer is beautiful, but the winter is icy cold with lots of snow. The roads there are generally
			only open from mid-July to mid-September. The mildest climate is found in Kinnaur, where it is
			possible to stay through the winter.</p>

			<p>These education projects are having far-reaching consequences for women
			and Buddhism in the Himalayan region. We deeply appreciate all assistance. Please click
